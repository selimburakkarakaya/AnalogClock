# AnalogClock

A mini analog clock application coded in javascript.
##

This JavaScript program implements an analog clock implementation that runs in the browser. The hour and minute hands of the watch are constantly updated according to the current date and time information.

How does it work?

1. The program updates the time information using a timer (setInterval) that runs at regular intervals in the browser.

2. Each time the timer is triggered, the current date and time information is retrieved (new Date()).

3. Time information is used to determine the position of the hour and minute hands:
  - According to the time information, the rotation angle of the hour hand is calculated.
  - According to the minute information, the rotation angle of the minute hand is calculated.
  - According to the seconds information, the rotation angle of the second hand is calculated.

4. The calculated rotation angles are updated via the CSS rotation property (transform: rotateZ) of the hour, minute and second hands, thus visually updating the time.

Features:

  - Automatic Update: Time information is updated every second and time indications are consistently displayed accurately on devices ranging from smartphones to computers.
  - Visual Elegance: Fluid rotation movements of the hour, minute and second hands make the analog watch experience realistic.
  - Simple and User-Friendly: Users can follow real-time time information by opening this application in their browser.

This simple yet impressive app brings the analog watch experience to digital platforms and gives users a visual representation of the time.
